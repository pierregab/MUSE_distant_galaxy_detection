# MUSE_distant_galaxy_detection
This repository contains MATLAB scripts tailored for the analysis of astronomical data from the HDFS MUSE (High Deep Field South Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) dataset. The primary goal of these scripts is to facilitate the detection and analysis of very distant galaxies through advanced spectral analysis techniques.
